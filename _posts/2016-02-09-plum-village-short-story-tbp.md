## About Plum Village story

Who would have thought that you could find your soul in the land of fashion, romance, and wine.

France. The land of baguettes and cafe au laits. The land of romance. The land of cheese, wine and millionaires. France is known for a lot of things, but the one thing that does not come to mind when thinking of France is monastic living and reaching a state of desirelessness. After all, isn't France one of the most coveted countries in the world?

A young lady found her solace in a retreat tucked away in South France, at the beginning of her career when she found virtually no satisfaction nor contentment in the fast-paced, rat race world. Surrounded in the city life of dealing with Chicago, Delhi, New York City, and London on a daily basis at work, skyping, emailing, and analyzing endless amounts of data for big name corporations like Kraft, American Eagle, and Burberry, she found herself getting busier and busier as the days flew by, yet ever more empty inside and lacking a sense of depth and deep rooted satisfaction.

Finding the chance to slip away from the globalized, always-on life, and into the slightly off-the-grid, remote location in the countryside of France, she found hope in reconnecting with the essence that animated her spirits as a child that she found herself losing as a young adult as the responsibilities grew thicker and remembrances of 'the why's' and meanings of life vacillated into dissipated nothingness.

Follow the short story of this young lady who discovered the chance to save her soul at the onset of a fully lucrative career and remind herself of why, despite the lack of material gain, it's fully rewarding to 'never grow up,' and forever remain her inner child, her highest self of love and freedom.
