# Support Services

It is getting more and more difficult to find real friends who actually support you and want you to find your true nature.

Most people today are fending for themselves, and if they are publicly posting Facebook posts and Google+ posts about new age, meditation, living out your truth, etc, chances are, they are too busy re-posting and sharing images instead of actually supporting the people who are sitting right next to them, or who live with them.

We have become an increasingly self-serving society. That is totally okay. After all, I am also suggesting as everyone else, that you be selfish and find your true nature, in order to evolve and grow.

But when I say this, I really, really mean it. I am actually obsessed about it. It is my obsession. Helping people learn more about their strengths, through talking with them, listening to their problems, and just paying total attention to them and giving them 100% of my focus, love, and energy, is a genuine past-time of mine.

I don't say this to brag. I just say it because it is something I cannot help. After all, the landlord of my vedic astro-house of relationships is pacified. This means that I can tend to lose myself in relationships. You heard me correctly, I lose myself in relationships.

This sounds like a total weakness, doesn't it? Well, on the contrary. If a person knows how to use this perceived 'weakness' as an asset, they can learn to use their innate tendencies (such as losing oneself in a relationship) and use it to provide service to others. It's a win-win.

As you follow me along in my posts, you will discover bits and pieces of my childhood that I will reveal to you. A fact about me is that I struggled a lot with relationships. I used to get really involved too soon, and would be there to support my friend, boyfriend or family member, 100% of the way. We would mainly talk about them and their problems. 

As I grew older, I made the tough decision to let some of these friendships go, as I realized that I needed friends who were just as supportive as I was. When I learned to set boundaries for myself, I started attracting people and relationships where the support was completely mutual. And I found mentors, strong women, and intelligent men who still stand by me today.

I will share more about my teachers, mentors, friends, and support network as time goes on.
