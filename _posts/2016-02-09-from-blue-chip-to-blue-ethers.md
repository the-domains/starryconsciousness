# from blue-chip to blue-ethers

Finding your expression is the next step after discovering your purpose. You cannot express that which you do not know. Living someone else's Dharma or purpose breeds fear and insecurity, and if you are far from living your purpose, chances are, you are filled with fear and insecurity, and it is only a matter of time for the fear and insecurity to bubble over the pot and make a big mess.

Let's say you did the work to find your true purpose, and you are finding yourself living more and more from your truth and heart center, rather than from what your intellect and ego is telling you. You haven't left your job, but you are actively seeking opportunities to leave blue-chip and explore the worlds of  the blue-ethers.

You are about to break out of the golden-handcuffs and get in control of these odd but increasingly common occurrences of being highly empathic of those around you and picking up on the vibes of others.

The next step you need to take, is not to quit your day job just yet, but rather see if you can negotiate with leadership on a set plan for you and how you can work in tandem to get the work done, but still have the capability to work at maximum 40 hours a week. It sounds like you are being lazy, but really what you are doing is starting to learn to say "No" to certain projects that are not serving your well-being. To earn possibly $5,000 to $10,000 more in the year really is not worth the extra time spent, especially after taxes.

The best thing would be to scale back your intensity at the office, and redistribute your energy and focus towards developing your new found purpose.

Expression can only happen through practice. If you do not take action on the expression, it will never occur.

Going from blue-chip to blue-ethers can be a scary thing, but it is possible, if you play your cards correctly.
