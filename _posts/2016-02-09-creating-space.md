Creating the space within yourself to change, evolve, grow and develop into your fullest potential can only happen on one initiating circumstance: you are completely, totally, devoid of all thought, material, and are completely, 100% empty. 

Creating space is a simple task. 

Yet we find ourselves struggling to achieve this.

In fact, don't you find yourself feeling overwhelmed, with ideas, emotions, information? It's as if there is information-overload in at every turn and every corner. 

Creating space within yourself is akin to creating space within your 10x10 office or cubicle. It is similar to filing away papers that no longer serve you, and getting rid of accessories and objects that compete for your attention rather than provide you ample support to get the task done.

The toughest part of it all is, especially for you hoarders out there, is the emotional catharsis that you have to deal with when saying goodbye to something that has been by your side since day 1\. 

How do you create the space within yourself? Send your comments below, I love hearing from you.
