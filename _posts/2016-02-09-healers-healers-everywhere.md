# Healers, healers, everywhere

It is very trendy to be a healer today. Many people are doing it for various reasons. Many claim they want to help humanity, but the unfortunate truth is that it's actually their ego that tells them they should be a healer.

Does your healer or health coach undermine your strength, or does she see it clearly, show it to you and lift you up with it?

You cannot just see if  healer is the right healer for you by looking at their credentials. Many people say things like, Amma told me to go into healing, or Amma is my guru, and therefore I am qualified to heal. Do not listen to this bull! Amma for those less worldly-spiritually inclined, is the hugging Guru, born and grew up in South India.

Do not listen to these people. If you feel that they heal you, great, but please keep in mind if they are charging ridiculous rates like $400 to $500 per session, or near that amount. It should not cost that much to conduct a healing session.

Furthermore, I stand firm that everyone is a healer, and rather than make it a full-time 'career,' a healer should focus their efforts on empowering the client in so many other ways. Like the ways that I do for my clients. I do not just give you an energy healing session. I work _with_ you to define your root issue, and guide you to become the ultimate healer of yourself. I do not pray that you will sign up for 20 sessions with me, charged at $300 an hour, for me to 'heal' you "Prrraiiiisee the lord jesus! halllellujiah!" 

\*ehem\*.

I got carried away. But the point is, you should **never, ever **catch yourself falling prey to 'healers' who take you on as a lifelong client. This does not make any logical sense. A true healer is someone who leads you to your natural, innate ability to heal yourself. 

Remember this, and you will save not just thousands, but hundreds of thousands of your precious earned cash.
