## Your Intellect is OOC

How can you move forward when you feel paralyzed in fear? They call this analysis paralysis. 

We can become too intellectual for our own good. Reasoned, left-brained thinking has brought much advancement to our ability to be comfortable in modern day life. While is has brought us more comforts and conveniences than we can count, at the same time, it has led us down a problem in which I like to call "automation hell." 

Rahu, the north node of the moon, does not have a body; it's just a head. It's a head with eyes popping out wide out of it's face, tongue hanging out whipping around crazily and smoke snorting out of it's nostrils, and it's heading every which way, possibly your way, at an automated speed that cannot be stopped.

Similarly, the technology we have created today has not only provided us with easier access to making purchases online, we can now make repeat purchases in our sleep, paying several vendors recurring fees every month, within the blink of an eye. We wake up one morning and our budget has been depleted. So we don't sleep well at night, because we have to keep a watchful eye on this monster we created, the automation machine.

Rahu is very hungry. He is never satisfied. Similarly, the intellect is never satisfied. It craves logic and reasoning, and if the algorithm is set to exponential Infinite limits, there is no ceiling and you have to be very sure you want to head in that direction before you hit 'Go.'

Our intellect will never be satisfied. What's more, is the intellect has been overplayed, and has won one too many times. 

It's sibling, Intuition, is sitting on the back-burner wondering where the party went. She is waiting, eagerly to be tapped into. She is just as important as Intellect. 

But the intellect is louder than intuition, simply because we give it more attention. 

Intuition is for fairies, some people say. To believe in fairies, you need to have faith. And faith did not invent the automated teller machine. 

So we leave Intuition aside, as we blindly follow our Intellect. And Intellect is Rahu. It will never sleep.

So, how will you put your Intellect to rest and come ask Intuition out to play?
