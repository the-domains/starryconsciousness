## The Wary Traveler Seeks the Answer

In the olden days, before electricity, before GPS, people had to navigate and travel through the world using only the GPS in their bodies and the stars in the sky. 

Why do I travel? I travel because we are looking for something, but I don't know what. I set milestones to benchmark and keep track that I am going in the right direction. Every now and then I check with a guide, a guru, a trusted advisor. Am I still on the path?

The Wary Traveler is someone who has been traveling for years and years, lifetimes and lifetimes, but continues to get lost in the forest in the mountains. If only he could get to the peak, then he could see the whole picture clearly. So he continues traveling in search of the answer he seeks, but sometimes, he does not know the question he asks and thus he does not know the answer he seeks. 

So he travels and travels. What keeps him going? His faith that at some moment, one moment, he will finally find what he was looking for. He will find his final resting place.

Traveling the world is one aspect of finding the answers we seek. Traveling the world within is another aspect. Both are needed to find that resolution.
