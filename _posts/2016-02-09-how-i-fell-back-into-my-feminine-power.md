# How I Fell "Back" into My Feminine Power

Coming into Being, into your feminine power.

I used to be terrified of my feminine power. I was mortified. Perhaps I was burned at the cross in a past-life. Or stoned. Or humiliated publicly for stating my opinions.

I know that in this lifetime, I have been told I have 'lesbian-tendencies.' Because I had a lot of 'woman power,' I guess is what they say. And, I had a quick, proverbial mouth. With mars exalted in my chart near my house of speech, it makes sense.

So I learned to STFU when I was in college. I became obsessed with boys starting in high school. In my chart, it shows that I am absolutely infatuated with the opposite sex. Which I still am. But after endeavoring on my spiritual journey towards the Infinite Self, it is now I am proud to say UTC (under total control). 

I come from a family of mostly women, and yet we were all outsmarted by one (my) extremely powerful father, President of his corporation. And we were just pawns in his game. I rocked the boat with my behavior, actions, attitudes, and words. Soon I was marked as 'that child.'

I had a sharp tongue, and a rage that was kept civilized by my elders and my own fear of this deep, primal power. I soon learned at the age of 10 to turn this rage inward, because I would get in trouble if I ever released it.

Fast forward to age 20, and my body is in bad shape. I am too skinny, which is thanks to being a scorpio/sag rising...fire signs ruled by Mars, a fiery planet, and Jupiter, but the fire wins in the akash. This means that my metabolism is highly charged, too charged. Too skinny. Diseased looking skinny.

Because I turned the rage inward at age 10, I developed an autoimmune disease. My body began attacking itself...it couldn't tell what was 'with it or against it.'

My autoimmune illness takes hold of my body and I live the next 10 years in total agony over my lost youth. Where did my sense of wit go? Where did this sassy little girl go? I became subdued and softened by all my peers telling me "I am too much and need to settle down."

I began thinking I was the problem. My aquarian mind, too unconventional for these Piscean people, and too 'out there' for normal folks.

As I was approaching my mid-twenties, the years in which you are supposed to get really good at a high paying job, and pin down a good man and 'catch him and keep him,'  I decided to abandon all self-love and decided to compromise my truest self, all in the name of 'fitting in,' and 'finding love.'

I was flamboozing and flamb√©ing around like a piece of meat with too many 'lover boy friends' between age 20 and 25\. I spread myself too thin. With lover boys, but also with girlfriends that turned out to be complete frenemies, waiting for the fall of their 'bestie.' Ahhh......young Midwestern American life...

My point in sharing this story, is that I get you. I have been there. I have done that. I have been through many friends, and had many relationships. I know the in's and out's of the 'why's' of why people choose to be your friend. In some cases, some people choose to make you their friend, to only take your power away. You must be very cautious and aware of such people.

Giving your power away to all the people around you is the fastest, surest way, to self-perpetuated hell. You are digging your own grave, and it will be harder and harder to get out, the longer you waste time with people who don't act like real human beings, but rather like energy vampires.

This brings me to my next point:

Ladies, your vagina is not a bed-and-breakfast. Nor is it an all you an eat buffet. 

**You are losing your power because you are giving your female prowess away to too many people in your lives.**

Take it easy, I am not literally talking about having intercourse, here. It was just a figure of speech.

But what I do really mean, is, you are losing so much of your Intuition, your energy, through focusing on all the wrong things!

Remember one thing. You each contain a seed of primal rage, of feminine power within each of you. You have experienced lifetimes of abuse, just for being a woman. 

If you learn to tap into that seat of primal rage, you will unleash your power, and nothing can get in your way to achieve the unthinkable.

Be brave.
