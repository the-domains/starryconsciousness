## Turning inwards

> I really wish I had a clue as to what I am supposed to do with my life. I feel so lost.

> My nerves are shot. I feel like I am being bombarded with information. TMI, everywhere.

> I feel like some people are clinging on to me for dear life, trying to get my attention. When I finally succeed at breaking my attention away from them and back to myself, they come crawling at me ten times more aggressively.

Do any of these situations remind you of someone you may know?

It is becoming common to experience what I call "energy-drainage" or "energy leakage." Energy-drainage is when you are involved in situations that drain you of all your energy and life force. At the end of the day, you feel totally shot, confused, lost, drained and struggling to survive and just live your life. Energy-leakage is what I call when you allow your energy to leak out when you give all your attention away to the news, mainstream media personalities, and other social media outlets.
